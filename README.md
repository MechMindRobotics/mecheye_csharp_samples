# C# Samples

This repository contains C# samples for Mech-Eye SDK.

## Installation

1. Download and install [Mech-Eye SDK](https://www.mech-mind.com/download/camera-sdk.html).
2. Clone this repository to a specific folder.
3. Open MechEyeCSharpSamples.sln file in Visual Studio (2019 is recommended), build and run it.
    > Make sure .Net Development is installed in Visual Studio.

## Sample list

There are four categories of samples: **Basic**, **Advanced**, **Util**, and **Laser**.  

- The category **Basic** contains samples that are related to basic connecting and capturing.  
- The category **Advanced** contains samples that use advanced capturing tricks.  
- The category **Util** contains samples that get and print information and set parameters.  
- The category **Laser** contains samples that can only be used on Mech-Eye Laser cameras.  

The samples marked with `(EmguCV)` require [Emgu.CV.runtime.windows](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Emgu.CV.runtime.windows/) to be installed via NuGet.
